SLogo addition (mra21 - Miguel Anderson)

###Estimation: before looking at the old code:

*how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?*

2 hours

*how many files will you need to add or update? Why?*

I don't think I will need to update that many files, perhaps 2. This is becuase the functionality is already there. I don't know how many files I will have to add. Definitely one and that might be it. If I decide to encapsulate a little more I may extract out some classes, adding to the total file count. 

###Review: after completing the feature:

*how long did it take you to complete this new feature?*

About an hour

*how many files did you need to add or update? Why?*

I only updated one file. I updated the Turtle Menu file where Turtle related front end commands are held.

*did you get it completely right on the first try?*

After reminding myself about how Menus and MenuItems worked, I quickly came to the solution to the problem. Most of the functionality was already there. We had an image change button and a menu that listed all turtle IDs. The new feature was relatively easy.

###Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?

*was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?*

The documentation was very weak. My memory is what really helped me with this exercise. However the public methods in TurtleMaster (which I wrote) were very helpful and made this process quite easy.

*what could be improved?*

Comments on all public methods would have helped, for sure.

*what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?*

It would have been nearly impossible, fore sure.
