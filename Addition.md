###Estimation: before looking at the old code:
####how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?

Half an hour

####how many files will you need to add or update? Why?

At most two. I just need to add a command and adjust the property file.

###Review: after completing the feature:
####how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
An hour.
####how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
I end up updating four files. There is one file that I missed to think of, the Artist class. 
####did you get it completely right on the first try?
No.

###Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
####was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
I think it is as good as I remembered. I could clearly remember and follow the logic of inheritance and find the class that I need to modify. In my cases those are Artist and Canvas.

####what could be improved?
I think more documentation could definitely help. Like notes on which classes each class depend on. 

####what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
Then it would probably take two times as much time to spot the right classes and make modification. Debugging would also take longer.
